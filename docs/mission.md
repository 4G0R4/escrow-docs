## Mission Statement

Bitcoin is the future of money. 

In order to acheive this, we have adopted the following design priniples:

```md
  * Be competitive       : Make Bitcoin a cheaper, faster, and better form of escrow.
  * Keep it simple       : The protocol should be easy to use, understand, and audit.
  * Short and sweet      : Use as few rounds of communication as possible.
  * Remain discreet      : Do not require (or leak) any sensitive information.
  * Custody is cancer    : We must actively avoid any form of custody in the protocol at all times.
  * Keys are radioactive : Avoid bad practices that can expose private keys (which give us cancer).
```
